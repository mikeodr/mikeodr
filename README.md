I am a software developer with 14 years experience working on low level drivers, robotics, networking and cybersecurity. I've shipped millions of phones, hundreds of robots, and secured thousands of customer networks.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering and working on [automating my home](https://github.com/mikeodr/Home-AssistantConfig/)
